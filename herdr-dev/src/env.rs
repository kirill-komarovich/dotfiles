//! What crosses the boundary into a process we start, and what must not.
//!
//! A daemon outlives the shell that started it and serves every project on the machine, so its own
//! environment is an accident of birth: whichever pane first ran a verb, carrying whatever that
//! directory's mise files had already exported into it. Handed down whole, one project's `PORT`
//! becomes the floor under every other project's units.
//!
//! `mise exec` cannot undo that. It layers a project's config over what it is handed and clears
//! nothing it has no opinion about, so a var the project does not declare — by design, the caller's
//! business — arrives untouched. A project that declares no `PORT` therefore inherits a stranger's.
//!
//! So nothing project-scoped crosses. What survives describes the machine and the user, and every
//! project-scoped value reaches a unit the one way the spawn recipe intends: `mise exec` with the
//! unit's own cwd.

/// The machine and the user, never a project.
