//! The tests that run by default create nothing: they point the daemon at a docker socket that does
//! not exist, which is how §9's `unknown` and its stale cache are exercised without a container
//! anywhere near them.
//!
//! The test marked `#[ignore]` does create containers — a throwaway compose project of its own under
//! the temporary directory, from `alpine:latest` in the local image store, pulling nothing — and takes
//! it down again on the way out. Run it with `cargo test -- --ignored`.
