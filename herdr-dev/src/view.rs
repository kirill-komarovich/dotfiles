//! What the popup is looking at: the project the key resolved to, plus the sibling repos its manifest
//! names — one collapsed row each, unfolded with `↹` into that repo's own units (§5, §12).
//!
//! An included repo is a project in its own right. Its rows come from its own manifest — its own
//! commands, its own compose services, its own `hidden` and `one_shot` — and every verb, log and state
//! key carries that repo's own path (§8), so a unit started from the including view is the same unit
//! from the repo's own view, and stopping it from either is one act on one thing.
//!
//! **One level.** An include inside an included manifest is never followed. That is what keeps
//! game_server's 15 services from unfolding uninvited, and it is a floor rather than an oversight.
